## Getting Started

To quickly get started with this repository using Visual Studio Code and Dev Containers:

1. **Open in VS Code**: Launch Visual Studio Code and open the repository folder.
2. **Install Dev Containers Extension**: Make sure you have the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed.
3. **Reopen in Container**: When prompted, or via the Command Palette (`F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`), select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`. VS Code will build and open the project inside a development container.
4. **Run Code**: Use the integrated terminal or VS Code Run/Debug features to execute Python scripts within the container.

This approach provides a consistent, isolated development environment with all dependencies pre-installed.

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mumehta/python-algo.git

  ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
